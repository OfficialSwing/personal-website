Dev Link is a full-stack social media web app aimed towards software developers. It's made easy for developers to create a profile, showcase their skills, experience & projects, and to easily find other developers that fit a certain set of requirements.

In the creation of this project, I learned how to plan and develop a medium-sized full-stack web app from scratch using modern technologies.

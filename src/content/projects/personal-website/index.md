My personal site was built using Gatsby.js, the fantastic modern react SSR framework. I took advantage of GraphQL and the many available plugins to thoroughly optimize the final site and query data from different data sources.

I loved making this site and particularly enjoyed implementing a dark mode theme which involves injecting a script before loading the content to detect user theme preferences.

Hello! I'm Paul, a curiosity-driven full-stack web developer based in Manchester, UK.

I love the constant learning, creating and problem solving that comes with developing exceptional websites and applications. My goal as a developer is to provide pixel-perfect products that feel satisfying and are scalable and efficient under the hood.

I graduated from [Manchester University](https://www.https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) with a maths degree in 2015 and have been continuously working on my skills in web development since.

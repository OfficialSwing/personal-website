My personal site was built using Gatsby.js, the fantastic modern react SSR framework.

I took advantage of GraphQL and the many Gatsby plugins to thoroughly optimize the site and easily query data from different data sources. I also implemented a perfectly working dark mode which involves injecting a script before loading the content to detect user theme preferences.

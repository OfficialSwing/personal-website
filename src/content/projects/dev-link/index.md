Dev Link is a full-stack social media web app aimed towards software developers.

It allows developers to easily create a profile, showcase their skills, experience & projects and quickly find other developers that fit certain requirements.

In the creation of this project, I learned how to plan and develop a medium-sized full-stack web app from scratch using modern technologies.
